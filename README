Title: Hacking on OpenStack's Nova source code.

Abstract:
Understanding the source code of an open source project is essential
not only to developers, but also to operators.
Nova, being the main project of OpenStack, covers the core functionality
in which OpenStack provides.
Therefore understanding the inner structure of Nova should be benefitial
to people related in all aspects.
This talk is about the structure of Nova's source code with an example
to help you to understand the overall process scheme of OpenStack.
At the end, I briefly introduce how you can contribute
to the OpenStack community.
